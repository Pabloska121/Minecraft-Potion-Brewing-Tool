    "paragraph_1": "Potions in Minecraft are special items that provide positive or negative effects when consumed or used. There are three main types of potions: <strong>Awkward</strong>, <strong>Splash</strong>, and <strong>Lingering</strong>. Awkward Potions are the base for many other potions and are made by mixing a <strong>Nether Wart</strong> with a <strong>Water Bottle</strong> in the brewing stand. Splash Potions are throwable versions created by adding <strong>Gunpowder</strong>, allowing the effect to impact multiple mobs or players at once. Lingering Potions are made by adding <strong>Dragon's Breath</strong> to a Splash Potion, creating a persistent cloud that applies the effect to anyone who passes through it.",
    "paragraph_2": "Each type of potion requires specific ingredients to be brewed, which determines its effect. For example, a <strong>Potion of Healing</strong> is made with a <strong>Glistering Melon Slice</strong>, while a <strong>Potion of Strength</strong> is brewed with <strong>Blaze Powder</strong>. Knowing the correct ingredients is crucial to achieving the desired effect, as using the wrong ones can result in negative effects or potions with no benefits.",
    "paragraph_3": "In addition to potion brewing, they can be <strong>enhanced</strong> or <strong>extended</strong>. To enhance a potion, <strong>Glowstone Dust</strong> is used, increasing its potency but reducing its duration. To extend the duration of a potion, <strong>Redstone Dust</strong> is added, which lengthens the effect time without changing its strength. These modifications allow players to tailor potions to their strategic needs and maximize their effectiveness in different game situations.",
